## Project Overview
This project implements a real-time data processing system to monitor weather conditions and provide summarized insights using rollups and aggregates. It utilizes data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api). The application fetches weather data for various metropolitan areas in India and processes it to provide daily summaries, alert thresholds, and the ability to visualize the results.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js (if used for extending functionality).
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **dotenv**: Module to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **Nodemon**: Development tool that automatically restarts the server on file changes.
- **Mocha & Chai**: Testing framework and assertion library (if you choose to include testing).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-monitoring.git
